<div>
  Name of source project for cloning the slave
  <p/>
  The slave for this build will be created by cloning a slave from a build from
  this project. See the build selector below for how to specify the build.
  Cloning a slave exposes all artifacts from the source without copying any
  files. Note that the source must also be a clone-based project (e.g.,
  vsphere-cloud or docker plugin).
