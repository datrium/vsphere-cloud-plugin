# vSphereCloud CloneableProject Jenkins Plugin

When using [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io) as the primary test execution
engine in a large organization, a number of challenges are present:

* dealing with large build and test deliverables/artifacts
* scale and performance of test troughput (tests per build)

* when using Jenkins' archive artifacts, data is frequently copied twice:
  (1) once to master, and then (2) to some shared storage, like NFS
* artifact sizes are limited to 2gb
* when using the CopyArtifacts plugin for downstream tests, data is copied
  the master to the slave

This amount of data movement is often times the primary test performance
and throughput bottleneck. At Datrium, we've avoided this by using a
clone-based workflow, which allows artifacts to be saved and consumed
with zero-copy.
