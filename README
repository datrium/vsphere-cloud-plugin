# vSphereCloud CloneableProject Jenkins Plugin

At [Datrium](https://www.datrium.com), we use [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io) for generating builds and executing tests.

## Why
We've been using a clone-based workflow for the last 4 years because it allows
us to build, test and triage efficiently. Our workflow was previously decoupled
from Jenkins. We injected a build-step into each job to manage the workflow.
But, in order to contribute to the Jenkins community, we've converted our
workflow into a proper Jenkins plugin.
